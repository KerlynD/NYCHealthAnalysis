# NYC HEALTH ANALYSIS PROJECT

This is a personal project made by Kerlyn Difo, all data used is from the NYC Open Data Community. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to understand the health status and behaviors of New York City adults 
and identify patterns or correlations between different health factors (e.g., lack of health insurance 
and access to medical care).

Some Key Questions:
- What percentage of adults lacks health insurance, personal doctors, or access to medical care?
- Are there correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages, smoking, obesity) 
and health outcomes (e.g., access to medical care, colon cancer screening)?

## Personal Goal
As a student in Queens College currently trying to pursue Data Analytics & Engineering, I want to develop projects that
help me not only evolve my skills, but also help my community by analyzing our collected data to curate a solution to our
ongoing health issues. 

#### _Programming_
For this project, I really wanted to develop my skills in Databases & Python.  
Specifically, SQLite & using the simplicity of it to my advantage for this project.

#### _Data Science_
I also want to improve my mathematical analysis and process. Statical analysis, pattern recognition, creating processes 
for discovering valid correlations between data.

#### _Machine Learning_
For this project, since the data is smaller & for the main part clean, I want to develop a predictive model to see if 
I can predict health outcomes based on other variables within the table.

## Project Objectives
- Defining the Problem:
  - Understand the health status and behaviors of New York City adults and identify patterns or 
correlations between different health factors (e.g., lack of health insurance and access to medical care).
- Data Collection & Preparation:
  - Load the data in the SQLite database & prepare it for cleaning (i.e., Checks for inconsistent or missing data &
normalize any data if needed ensuring consistency)
- Exploration and Analysis:
  - Summary Statistics: Use SQL queries to calculate basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode) for each column.
  - Pattern Recognition: Look for trends over time by grouping data by year and analyzing changes.
  - Correlations: Identify potential correlations between variables using SQL or Python (pandas for correlation matrices).
- Model Building:
  - Predictive Model: Use the 'scikit-learn' module to predict health outcomes based on other variables.
- Visualization & Presentation:
  - Dashboard Creation: Use a tool like 'Tableau' to create an interactive dashboard.
  - Include visual elements such as line graphs for trends, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and heatmaps for correlations.
