File to query the data from the Database & conduct the statistical analysis on prevalence data
Definitions to remember:
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: is a correlation coefficient that measures linear
correlation between two sets of data.
It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations;
thus, it is essentially a normalized measurement of the covariance,
such that the result always has a value between âˆ’1 and 1.
